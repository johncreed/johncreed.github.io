## Reflection

### Week 5

- Algorithm

1. read problem and test cases!! Don't rush to write code.
2. KMP algo.
3. segmentation tree structure
4. reduced segmentation tree structure
5. binary search termitation condition

### Week 4 (Burnout)

- Unsuccessful defense against bunrout:

Consequences:

1. Unproductive at Fri, Sat and Sun.
2. Feel bad about myself.
3. Disrupted life style (poor sleep quality / bing-watch Netflix & Youtube / Insufficient excercise )

Possible sourece:
1. Gauss-Newton EXP
2. Interview meeting with Google HR.
3. Interview bomb from Shoppee.
4. Lab funding plan and reimbursement.
5. Unintended commitment toward software development.
6. Uncatched self-challenged progress.
7. Extensive working on CV, which is deeply related to my self-worth and validation.

Possible solution:

1. Seek out companion to reduce anxiety.
2. Prioritize and Execute. Remake a workable schedule.
3. Meditation and Exercise.

### Week 3

- The relation between level and node of tree:

level 0: 2^(0+1) - 1 = 1

level 1: 2^(1+1) - 1 = 2

...

level k: 2^(k+1) - 1

- Not familiar with recursion struction:

The function may contain (state) and in the function needs a terminatoin criteria.

"Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm." from (https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~matuszek/cit594-2012/Pages/backtracking.html)


- Common prefix of a set of strings : Trie.

- LinkList-hashmap structure:

O(1) query from key

O(1) swap any two element order

O(1) remove head or tail element


- C++ random generator (TODO)


- encode integer to string (TODO) 297	Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
